# NeighborhoodLibrary

This program simulates a library check-in/out system that records the status of the books and its borrows through a CLI. The book name, ISBN, and ID will be recorded into an adjustable list.

Users wil have the ability to edit the library database and can perform the following actions:

◾List all available books  
◾Check out available books  
◾List all checked out books  
◾Check in books

### Interesting Code

I think the simple "if" conditional statement below is interesting since it tests to check for the user's integer input as well as the boolean in one line without using &&.

'''
 if (books[choice].isCheckcedOut() == false) 
 '''
